# Lightroom Photo Gallery

Export your images from Lightroom as full resolution and thumbnail resolution
images. Place them into the `images` directory. Zip the full resolution images
into a file called `download.zip` and place that in the `images` directory, as
well.

Next, create an `env.js` file (copy from `env.sample.js`) and update the values
to match your naming convention.

Finally, open `index.html` and ensure everything renders as expected. Upload
the contents to your production location for the gallery.
